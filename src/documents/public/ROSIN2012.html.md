# IROS'12 Workshop on Robots and Sensors integration in future rescue INformation system (ROSIN'12), October 11th, 2012

<a href="http://www.iros2012.org/" title="IROS 2012"><img src="http://www.iros2012.org/site/sites/default/files/imgs/iros2012_header_04.png" border="0" alt="IROS 2012" style="width: 800px;" /></a>

This **half-day** workshop will take place October 11th, 2012 in Vilamoura, Algarve (Portugal) during the [2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](http://www.iros2012.org/) (IROS'12). This workshop is supported by the IEEE Robotics and Automation’s Technical Committee on [Safety Security and Rescue Robotics](http://tab.ieee-ras.org/committeeinfo.php?tcid=21).

## Motivation and objectives
Intelligent rescue systems including <abbr title='Information and Communications Technology'>ITC</abbr> and robotics technology have been proposed to mitigate disasters, especially in Japan after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Ideally, these future search&rescue systems will involve a complex mixture of humans performing high level decision-making, intelligent agents coordinating the response, sensing capabilities to provide real-time observations and possibly mobile robots undertaking physical tasks at difficult or risky remote places in order to provide an efficient disaster response on a large-scale environment. However, there are several challenges to address before such a scenario could take place because the considered environments are prone to uncertainty, ambiguity and incompleteness given their dynamic and evolving nature. First, in the robotic domain for search&rescue most of nowadays robots are operated by humans. While this is required by the harsh conditions commonly found in disaster sites (collapsed buildings, gaps, holes, flooding ...), there are many limitations in human operated robots where the dependency on well-trained operators obviously limits the deployment of such robots. In addition, due the very limited number of available robots and their very customized hardware (both in terms of mobility and actuation capabilities), it is necessary in a disaster recovery campaign to carefully and rapidly identify both the deployment location and the type of the robots to be deployed. Secondly, while the monitoring capability of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) make them very suitable for large scale surveillance systems random deployment can not guarantee coverage both for sensing and connectivity and concerns. In addition, while scalar sensors are quite easy to manage they however provide very limited information compared to what multimedia sensors could bring if video or images were available. In general, a wide range of wireless sensor network applications can be strengthened by introducing a vision capability and, in the domain of search&rescue, which is extremely mission-critical in nature, adding visual capabilities is considered to be of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, video or image sensors are much more difficult to manage on a large scale because of the more demanding resources they need for their operation and for transmitting visual information to a control center. 

Therefore the objective of this workshop is to bring together robotics and WSN (Wireless Sensor Networks) researchers to:

- present both state-of-the-art results and work in progress in the area of distributed sensing in the context of robotic and sensor networks integration for search&rescue systems,
- to foster multi-disciplinary collaborations between researchers working on different topics: WSN (Wireless Sensors Network), robotic, disaster management, information systems, ... thus forming a base for future collaboration.

ROSIN 2012 is the second workshop dedicated to these issues. [ROSIN 2010](ROSIN2010.html) took place in 2010 in Taipei, Taiwan during the 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'10). In this first edition, we accepted 7 papers. 20 people attended the half-day workshop. The proceedings of this workshop are freely available on the web site. 

## List of topics
This workshop will focus on the tight integration of sensors-robots and information systems during the rescue process. Topics that are of special interest include but are not limited to:

- Distributed information gathering with heterogenous teams (UAS & UGV, UAS & USV, robots&sensors),
- Information systems for disaster management including Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDDS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and participatory GIS, adaptive software for rescue robotics,
- Advanced data management with mobile robots and sensors, GIS spatial representation for robotic systems,
- Communication and control protocols for robot-sensor interaction including coverage and maintenance of network connectivity,
- Simulation of robots and sensors,
- Role of robots and sensors in disaster and emergency management processes.

The primary audience of the proposed workshop is intended to be researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry with an interest on integration robots, sensors and information systems in the context of disaster or emergency management. In addition, researchers and practitioners from related communities (disaster management, SDDS, GIS) will find this workshop quite useful.

## Journal Special Issue
After the workshop, extended version of the papers could be submitted to the following journal special issue:
