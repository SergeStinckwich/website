# 3rd International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and models for ROBotic systems (DSLRob-12)

The Third International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and Models for Robotic Systems (DSLRob'12) was held at the [2012 International Conference on Simulation, Modeling, and Programming for Autonomous Robots (SIMPAR 2012)](http://www.2012.simpar.org/), November 2012 in Tsukuba, Japan.

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) are emerging areas of interest in the robotics research community. Both have been instrumental for resolving complex issues in a wide range of domains, including e.g. distributed and modular robotics, control, and vision. The goal of this workshop is to bring together robotics researchers working with DSLs and models in different aspects of robotics.

## Description

A [domain-specific language (DSL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the robotics domain.

The main objective of this workshop is a cross-pollination of ideas between robotics researchers in DSLs and models from different domains. DSLs and models are key elements in many robotic systems presented at leading conferences such as IROS and ICRA, but the domain-centric structure of the typical robotics conference does not offer a natural venue for exchange of ideas regarding DSLs and models.

This workshop will focus on the use of Domain-Specific Languages and Models for Robotic Systems. Topics that are of special interest include:

- domain-specific languages to express reactive behaviors, composition of behaviors, motion description languages (MDL),
- domain-specific languages to express uncertainty, modelling of physical system, real-time constraints,
- domain-specific languages to describe cooperative robotics and modular robotics systems,
- tools support and frameworks for describing and manipulating DSLs, models and meta-models for robotic systems,
- code generation and code transformation for robotics systems, variability in robotic systems,
- meta-models to express robotic specific structures and best practices,
- frameworks to combine DSLs in an uniform manner,
- benchmarks to compare use of DSL vs general-purpose programming, and
- programming languages in the context of robotic systems, visual languages for robots, languages to teach robotics.

The intended audience is those robotics researchers throughout the entire robotics community who use DSLs and models as a key component of their robotics software infrastructure. In addition, robotics researchers with an interest in modern approaches to solving complex software-related issues will find the workshop inspirational.

## Relation to previous workshops organized

This is the third installment of this workshop: the first edition [DSLRob 2010](DSLRob2010) was held at IROS 2010 and the second edition [DSLRob 2011](DSLRob2011) was collocated with IROS 2011. In the second edition, we accepted 6 papers and more than 20 people attended the full-day workshop. 

The proceedings of the first edition are freely available on arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4563, and the proceedings of the second edition will be available soon (also on arXiv).

Serge Stinckwich also organized in International Workshop on DYnamic languages for RObotic and Sensors systems [DYROS 2010](DYROS2010) during SIMPAR-2010 (Darmstadt, Germany) and [DYLA 2012](http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/events/dyla2012) during ECOOP-2012 (Beijing, China).
