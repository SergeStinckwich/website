# IROS'10 Workshop on Robots and Sensors integration in future rescue INformation system (ROSIN'10), October 18th, 2010

This **full-day** workshop will take place October 18th, 2010 in [Taipei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei) (台北) Taiwan, during the [2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](www.iros2010.org.tw/) (IROS'10).

## Motivation and objectives
Intelligent rescue systems including ITC and robotics technology have been proposed to mitigate disasters, especially in Japan after the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Reports on urban emergency relief point out that the most serious difficulty is the delay of communication of reliable information between the authorities in charge, especially district authorities, which are supposed to coordinate efforts in real-time and make requests for support at the city level. In order to do that, the infrastructure of information systems during disasters plays an important role. Future rescue information systems may involve a complex mixture of humans performing high level decision-making, intelligent agents coordinating the response, sensors networks providing real-time observations and robots undertaking physical tasks in large-scale environments with the possibility of taking part in the process of data collection. However, the considered environments are prone to uncertainty, ambiguity and incompleteness given their dynamic and evolving nature.

The aims of the workshop are:
- To present both state-of-the-art results and work in progress in the area of distributed sensing in the context of robotic and sensor networks integration,
- To foster multi-disciplinary collaborations between researchers working on different topics: WSN (Wireless Sensors Network), robotic, disaster management, etc ... thus forming a base for future collaboration.

This workshop will focus on the tight integration of sensors-robots and information systems during the rescue process. Topics that are of special interest include but are not limited to:
- Distributed information gathering with sensors and robots,
- Information systems for disaster management including Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDDS), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and participatory GIS
- GIS-based approaches for controlling robots, Advanced data management with mobile robots and sensors, GIS spatial representation for robotic systems,
- Trust enhancement infrastructure for information gathering during a disaster, Co-design of communication and control protocols for robot-sensor interaction,
- Role of robots and sensors in disaster and emergency management processes.

The primary audience of the proposed workshop is intended to be researchers and practitioners both from academia and industry with an interest on integration robots, sensors and information systems in the context of disaster or emergency management. In addition, researchers and practitioners from related communities (disaster management, SDDS, GIS) will find this workshop quite useful.
