# 1st International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and models for ROBotic systems (DSLRob-10), October 2010

This workshop will take place in October 2010 in [Taipei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei) (台北) Taiwan, during the [2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](www.iros2010.org.tw/) (IROS'10).

# Description

A [domain-specific language (DSL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the robotics domain.

The main objective of this workshop is a cross-pollination of ideas between robotics researchers in DSLs and models from different domains. DSLs and models are key elements in many robotic systems presented at leading conferences such as IROS and ICRA, but the domain-centric structure of the typical robotics conference does not offer a natural venue for exchange of ideas regarding DSLs and models. This workshop will bring together robotics researchers from different parts of the robotics community, thus forming a base for future collaboration.

This workshop will focus on the use of Domain-Specific Languages and Models for Robotic Systems. Topics that are of special interest include:

- domain-specific languages to express reactive behaviors, variability in robotic systems (software product line),
- domain-specific languages to express uncertainty, modelling of physical system, real-time constraints,
- domain-specific languages to describe cooperative robotics and modular robotics systems,
- languages to teach robotics, visual languages for robotics,
- tools support and frameworks for describing and manipulating DSLs for robotic systems,
- model-driven engineering approaches for robotic systems,
- code generation and code transformation for robotics systems,
- frameworks to combine DSLs in an uniform manner,
- benchmarks to compare use of DSL vs general-purpose programming,
- programming languages in the context of robotic systems.

Type of workshop: **half-day**

The intended audience is those robotics researchers throughout the entire robotics community who use DSLs and models as a key component of their robotics software infrastructure. In addition, robotics researchers with an interest in modern approaches to solving complex software-related issues will find the workshop inspirational.
