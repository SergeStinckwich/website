<p>The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners in the South-East Asia region who are working in the area of disasters and risks. This conference will take place in Ha Noi, Vietnam from the 30th October to November 1st at the <a href="http://www.ifi.auf.org/">Institut de la Francophonie pour l&#39;Informatique</a> (IFI).</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The aim of this 3 day conference is to bring together both researchers and practitioners in the South-East Asian region that are working on state-of-the-art crisis information systems. The conference will be a unique opportunity to exchange information and knowledge, and provide a forum for discussion of new research results, best practices and case studies. The first day of the conference is dedicated to tutorials, this will be followed by 2 days of scientific presentations </p>
<p>ISCRAM Vietnam 2013 is part of the ISCRAM (Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management) (<a href="http://www.iscram.org/">http://www.iscram.org/</a>) conference series. The ISCRAM Association&#39;s primary mission is to foster a community dedicated to promoting research and development, exchange of knowledge and deployment of information systems for crisis management, including the social, technical and practical aspects of all information and communication systems used or to be used in all phases of management of emergencies, disasters and crises. Whilst there are several ISCRAM events organized within Europe and North America, the goal of the ISCRAM Vietnam conference is to bring together the large number of researchers and practitioners concerned with information systems for crisis management in the South East Asia region.</p>

<h2>Keynotes</h2>
<p>The conference will have two invited speakers: Julie Dugdale and Raffy Seldana.</p>
<h3>Julie Dugdale</h3>
<p><strong>ISCRAM community</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> The presentation tries to answer 2 main questions: who and what is ISCRAM, and what are the future challenges for Information systems for crisis management. Concerning the first aspect, the talk will explain the reason why ISCRAM is needed and what are its goals. Moving from theory to practice we will analyse what makes crisis management situations so unique, and from this, detail the implications for Information Systems design. The explosion in the use of new ICTs has changed how emergency and crisis information systems operate. drawing upon recent events, the talk will explore the implications of this new wave of IS.</p>
<p><strong>About the speaker</strong> Julie Dugdale is the leader of the MAGMA, Multi-agents research team at the Grenoble Informatics Laboratory in France. She is also an associate professor at the University of Grenoble 2 and an adjunct full professor at the University of Agder, Norway. Her research concerns agent based social simulation and focuses on modelling aspects of human behaviour - this is applied mostly to crisis management situations. Her work is strongly multidisciplinary, drawing together the domains of artificial intelligence, cognitive science and the social sciences. She has been involved in the ISCRAM community since 2004, having organised or co-organised several tracks (notably the intelligent systems track). She co-organised the ISCRAM PhD Doctoral Colloquium for 4 years and in 2010 she was very proud and happy to receive the ISCRAM Distinguished Service Award. Also in 2010 she was an invited keynote speaker at ISCRAM-CHINA, and in 2011 she was the Program Co-Chair for the main ISCRAM 2011 Conference in Lisbon. She is currently Vice President of ISCRAM.</p>
<h3>Raffy Seldana</h3>
<p><strong>Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management: Initiatives in the Philippines</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Located in the “Pacific Ring of Fire,” the Philippines is a hotbed of natural disasters. Every year, the country experiences a series of calamities such as typhoons, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions and other disasters that result to loss of precious lives and valuable properties. Records of the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) showed that the Philippines topped the list of countries with the highest mortality rate due to natural disasters in 2012.</p>
<p>This talk will focus on major projects in the Philippines in the area of information systems for crisis response and management with emphasis on disasters. These projects include government and non-government initiatives such as  (1) Project NOAH (Rainfall Monitoring and Flood Mapping Online), (2) Hazard Mapping in Metro Manila and other parts of the Philippines, and (3) Project &quot;Agos&quot; (Use of Social Media in Disaster Response and Management). Relevant experiences on how information and communications technologies help in disaster prevention and mitigation will be discussed. Possible areas of research collaboration will also be tackled.</p>
<p><strong>About the speaker</strong> Dr. Rafael P. Saldana is an Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics and Computing at the Department of Mathematics, School of Science and Engineering, Ateneo de Manila University. He obtained a Ph.D. in Computational Physics from Monash Univesity, Australia in 1998. He is also a member of the Technical Panel on Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) of the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD), Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines. He is a former president of the Computing Society of the Philippines (CSP), founding editor-in-chief of the Philippine Information Technology Journal (PITJ), former director of the Environmental Research Center of De La Salle University-Manila, and former consultant of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). He has undergone special training on supercomputing and high-performance computing. His research interests include mathematical modeling and computer simulation of complex systems, including natural and man-made disasters.</p>
