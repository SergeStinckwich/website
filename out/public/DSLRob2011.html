<p>The workshop will take place September 26th 2011 in San Francisco (USA) at a venue close to the <a href="http://www.iros2011.org/">IROS 2011</a> conference venue, but is not affiliated with IROS this year.</p>
<p>Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) are emerging areas of interest in the robotics research community. Both have been instrumental for resolving complex issues in a wide range of domains, including e.g. distributed and modular robotics, control, and vision. The goal of this workshop is to bring together robotics researchers working with DSLs and models in different aspects of robotics.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language (DSL)</a> is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level way for domain users to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction. DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems. However recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study. Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages often lead to a poor fit between the language features and the implementation requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel software solutions to complex problems within the robotics domain.</p>
<p>The main objective of this workshop is a cross-pollination of ideas between robotics researchers in DSLs and models from different domains. DSLs and models are key elements in many robotic systems presented at leading conferences such as IROS and ICRA, but the domain-centric structure of the typical robotics conference does not offer a natural venue for exchange of ideas regarding DSLs and models.</p>
<p>This workshop will focus on the use of Domain-Specific Languages and Models for Robotic Systems. Topics that are of special interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>dynamic languages for robotics,languages to teach robotics, visual languages for robotics, </li>
<li>domain-specific languages to express reactive behaviors, composition of behaviors, motion description languages (MDL),</li>
<li>domain-specific languages to express uncertainty, modelling of physical system, real-time constraints,</li>
<li>domain-specific languages to describe cooperative robotics and modular robotics systems,</li>
<li>tools support and frameworks for describing and manipulating DSLs for robotic systems,</li>
<li>code generation and code transformation for robotics systems, variability in robotic systems,</li>
<li>frameworks to combine DSLs in an uniform manner,</li>
<li>benchmarks to compare use of DSL vs general-purpose programming, and</li>
<li>programming languages in the context of robotic systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dynamic languages</strong> are considered a topic of special interest at this year&#39;s workshop: dynamic languages becoming more popular in the robotics community and often lead to a natural development of &quot;little languages&quot; that are precursors to more structured DSLs.</p>
<p>The intended audience is those robotics researchers throughout the entire robotics community who use DSLs and models as a key component of their robotics software infrastructure. In addition, robotics researchers with an interest in modern approaches to solving complex software-related issues will find the workshop inspirational.</p>
<h2 id="relation-to-previous-workshops-organized">Relation to previous workshops organized</h2>
<p>A <a href="DSLRob2010">first workshop</a> on the same topic already took place in october 2010 in Taipei, Taiwan during the 2010 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS&#39;10). In the first edition, we accepted 4 papers and had two additional presentations during the workshop. 15 people attended the half-day workshop. The <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4563">proceedings of this workshop</a> are freely available on arXiv. This new workshop will build on the experience and lessons learnt from the previous one.</p>
<p>Serge Stinckwich also organized last year the <a href="DYROS2010">International Workshop on Dynamic languages for RObotic and Sensors systems (DYROS 2010)</a> during SIMPAR-2010 (Darmstadt, Germany). This year&#39;s DSLRob workshop will include dynamic languages as a key topic which should serve to further attract interest from the community.</p>

<li>8h30-9h00 Welcome and introduction to the workshop</li>
<li>9h00-9h45 Invited talk: <strong>Improving Support for Modeling and Simulation of Cyber-physical Systems</strong>, <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~taha/">Walid Taha</a> (Rice University, USA), <strong>Abstract:</strong> The idea of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a paradigm shift. This talk focuses on one reason for why such a paradigm shift is necessary, namely, attained effective modeling and simulation support that can enable rapid design and development of future innovations in robotics.  The <a href="http://www.acumen-language.org/">Acumen</a> modeling language will be used for presenting basic concepts in hybrid systems, and some basic challenges in defining the semantics of such languages will be discussed.</li>
<li>9h45-10h15 Invited talk: <strong>A Robotics Task Coordination Language: Mastering Execution Variants at Run-Time</strong>, Andreas Steck and Christian Schlegel (Hochschule Ulm), <strong>Abstract:</strong> Robotic systems operating in open-ended real-world environments need to adapt their system configuration to the current situation and context at run-time. Design for run-time adaptability adds robotic-specific requirements on software structures, software engineering processes and representations of variability. This talk illustrates how &quot;&quot;SmartTCL&quot;&quot;, a domain-specific language for robotics task coordination, masters task execution variants at runtime, gives insights of why designing it in a particular way and reports on experiences made. We put &quot;&quot;SmartTCL&quot;&quot; into the overall context of bridging design-time and runtime model usage (model-centric robotic systems) and underpin the concepts by our &quot;&quot;SmartSoft&quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot;SmartMARS&quot;&quot; toolchain (model-driven software development for robotics based on a service-oriented software component model).</li>
