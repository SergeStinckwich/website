<p>This track will take place in Hammamet (Tunisia) from June 17th to 20th during the <a href="http://wetice2013.redcad.org/">22th IEEE International Conference Collaboration Technologies and Infrastructures (WETICE 2013)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This is the third installment of this workshop: the <a href="CT2CM2011">first edition</a> was held at WETICE 2011 and the <a href="CT2CM2012">second edition</a> at WETICE 2012.</strong></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>In crisis situations (natural or industrial disasters, riots, ...), the different actors managing crisis resolution have to act simultaneously in emergency situations to reduce its impacts on the real world. To achieve this common goal as quickly and efficiently as possible, these actors (police, military forces, medical organizations, NGOs but also emerging groups) have to collaborate and act in a coordinated way. In the term ‘coordination’, we include all the work needed for the actors, for the connected integration of their Information Systems and also for the flexible synchronization of their efforts, in order to handle the crisis in the most efficient way.
Coordination raises several problems such as the definition of the universe of discourse, without which it would be impossible to solve the various semantic conflicts that are bound to occur between several autonomous and heterogeneous actors and their Informations Systems. It involves the finding of partners, emergent partners integration, their collective decisions, partners plans negotiation and the synchronization of the distributed and concurrent execution of their actions and plans.
Moreover, in a highly dynamic, open, unstable and uncertain environment, such as the one met in crisis context, coordination should be redesigned to be more reactive, pro-active, adaptive, robust and visible for all the partners while preserving the essential part of their autonomy. It is intended that this track should focus mainly on the benefits of adopting collaborative enabling information technologies such as: Agent based-systems, Collaborative BPMS, Semantic Web or Group Decision Support Systems (DSS).</p>
<p>This track will try to address the following issues: how can collaborative information technologies help with the coordination of Crisis Management ? It is meant to cover the foundations, techniques, methodologies and applications of Collaborative Information Technologies for Coordinating Crisis Management. The track is interdisciplinary in nature and open to contributions from fields as varied as Cooperative Information Systems, Multi-Agent Systems, Business Process Management and the Semantic Web.</p>

<h2 id="submissions-guidelines">Submissions guidelines</h2>
<p>All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity. At least three reviews for each paper will be conducted. We are looking for submission of full research papers and reports on field studies (up to 6 pages). All track papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=wetice2013">Easychair website</a> and should use the IEEE US letter format. Every submitted paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the program committee. Accepted papers will be published along with the WETICE 2013 proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Note that at least one author from each accepted paper should register to attend WETICE 2013 for the paper to be published in the proceedings.</p>
